# music-challenge-generator

## Purpose
This repo is helping with creating musical composition challenges.
It randomly generates 3 components:
- time signature
- tempo
- chords

## Future Enhancements
- include all relevant time signatures for 4th, 8th and 16th
- generate a random style
- scrape free loop/sample sites for random selection
